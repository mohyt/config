Configs backup
My little configs tuned over time to suit my needs

Plain backups for me, but someone might find these useful.


1. vim

All plugins managed by pathogen.
Go support included.

vim/* goes to ~/


2. awesomewm

Heavily modified status bar (including system stats like cpu, ram, swap and hd)
Slightly modified theme
You should only use it if you read trough rc.lua and understand all the keybindings, most of them differ from standart ones
Mod key is Win key

awesomewm/rc.lua goes to /etc/xdg/awesome/
awesomewm/autostart goes to /etc/autostart (it's a simple script that starts all the stuff i need)
awesomewm/zenburn/ goes to /usr/local/share/awesome/themes/


3. htop

htop/htoprc goes to ~/.config/htop/


4. mc

mc/etc/* goes to /etc/mc/
mc/mc goes to ~/.config


5. lightdm

lightdm/lightdm_start.sh goes to /etc
lightdm/etc/* goes to /etc/lightdm/


You might want to merge these with your existing configs if you have those, instead of simply overwriting them
