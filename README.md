Personal vim configurations.

Plain backups for me, but someone might find these useful.

All plugins managed by pathogen.
Go support included.

Installation:

    git clone https://github.com/cr0n/vim.cfg
    cp -r vim.cfg/* ~/

You might want to merge it with your existing configs if you have those, instead of simply overwriting them
